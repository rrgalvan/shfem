*Simple High-performance Finite Element C++ library*

A C++ Finite Element library oriented to simplicity. And with the aim of:

- Make as easy as possible to understand FE development for
  undergraduate and master students

- Make easy to experiment with high performance tecniques: parallel linear
  algebra libraries, discontinous FE, high order FE, heterogeneous
  CPU/GPU environments...
